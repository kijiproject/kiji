### Motivation

The key-value pairs generated by mapper or gatherer tasks can be aggregated according to their keys by the MapReduce framework.
All the values associated with a given key can be processed by a reducer task to emit final, aggregated key-value pairs.

This makes reducers an important component of the KijiMR workflow:
A gatherer can output key-value pairs for each row processed in isolation,
but to compute aggregate statistics for the entire table,
gatherers must be complemented with appropriate reducers.

### Classes Overview

The Kiji framework provides two abstract base classes for reducers:
`org.kiji.reducer.KijiReducer` is the base class to use when implementing a reducer that emits key-value pairs.
`org.kiji.reducer.KijiTableReducer` is the base class to use when implementing a reducer that writes cells to a Kiji table.

### Using the API

All Kiji reducers extend the base class [`KijiReducer`]({{site.api_mr_1_0_0_rc62}}/KijiReducer.html) and must implement three methods:
*  `Class getOutputKeyClass()` and `Class getOutputValueClass()` to specify the classes of the output keys and values it emits;
*  `void reduce(InputKey key, Iterable<InputValue> values, Context context)` to implement the logic to reduce the set of input values for one input key in.
   The type of the input keys and input values are specific to each reducer.
   The `reduce()` method emits reduced (key, value) pairs using the reducer context with `context.write(key, value)`.

Optionally, a reducer may use `setup()` and `cleanup()` to initialize and finalize resources that can be reused during the reduce task.
These methods will be called once by each task, `setup()` before processing input records and `cleanup()` after the task is done processing input.

### Example

Here is a simplistic example of a reducer class that may be chained with the `FamilySizeGatherer` described in the gatherer section:

{% highlight java %}
/**
 * Example of a reducer class that, for every zip code, calculates
 * the number of families per family size.
 *
 * For its input, this reducer expects the output from the FamilySizeGatherer
 * presented in the gatherer section of the user guide.
 * This gatherer emits a key-value pair for every household with:
 *   <li> the household zip code as a key;
 *   <li> the number of members in the household as a value.
 *
 * For its output, this reducer emits key-value pairs where:
 *   <li> keys are strings encoded as "zip-code:family-size";
 *   <li> values are the number of families in the zip code with the size encoded in the key.
 */
public class FamilySizeReducer
    extends KijiReducer<IntWritable, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable>
    implements Configurable {

  /** {@inheritDoc} */
  @Override
  public Class<?> getOutputKeyClass() {
    // Pair (zip code, family size) encoded as a Text formatted "zip-code:family-size":
    return Text.class;
  }

  /** {@inheritDoc} */
  @Override
  public Class<?> getOutputValueClass() {
    // Number of families whose size if the size encoded in the key:
    return IntWritable.class;
  }

  /** {@inheritDoc} */
  @Override
  protected void reduce(IntWritable zipCode, Iterable<IntWritable> familySizes, Context context)
      throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    // Map: family size -> number of families with this size
    final Map<Integer, AtomicInteger> sizeMap = Maps.newHashMap();

    // Count the number of families with :
    for (IntWritable familySize : familySizes) {
      AtomicInteger count = sizeMap.get(familySize.get());
      if (count == null) {
        count = new AtomicInteger(0);
        sizeMap.put(familySize.get(), count);
      }

      // Increment the counter for this family size:
      count.incrementAndGet();
    }

    // Emit the generated family size map for zipCode:
    for (Map.Entry<Integer, AtomicInteger> entry : sizeMap.entrySet()) {
      final int familySize = entry.getKey();
      final int familyCount = entry.getValue().get();
      context.write(
          new Text(String.format("%s:%s", zipCode, familySize)),
          new IntWritable(familyCount));
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This reducer may be chained to the FamilySizeGatherer described in the gatherer section of this user guide as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
kiji gather \
    --gatherer=my.application.package.FamilySizeGatherer \
    --reducer=my.application.package.FamilySizeReducer \
    --input="format=kiji table=kiji://.env/default/household_table_name" \
    --output="format=seq file=hdfs://localhost:9000/reducer_output.seq nsplits=3"
{% endhighlight %}

This command line run a gatherer with the reducer described above.
The output of the job will be written as 3 Hadoop sequence files in HDFS in the directory specified with `hdfs://localhost:9000/reducer_output.seq/`.
Each reducer task will write a sequence file named `hdfs://localhost:9000/reducer_output.seq/part-r-<reducer #>`.
The number of gatherer tasks is currently set to be the number of regions in the input table.
The number of reducer tasks, hence the number of `part` files, is configurable via the `nsplits` job output parameter.


### Provided Library Classes

The `org.kiji.mapreduce.lib.reduce` package of the KijiMR Library comes with a number of reducers.
The most immediately useful ones for an application developer include `org.kiji.mapreduce.lib.reduce.IntSumReducer`,
`org.kiji.mapreduce.lib.reduce.LongSumReducer` and `org.kiji.mapreduce.lib.reduce.DoubleSumReducer`.
These are [`KijiReducer`]({{site.api_mr_1_0_0_rc62}}/KijiReducer.html) versions of reducers that compute the sums of all the values associated with each key.

These reducers are examples of subclasses of the abstract class `org.kiji.mapreduce.lib.reduce.KeyPassThroughReducer`,
which is a convenience superclass for KijiReducers that use the same keys as the map phase.

See the KijiMR Library JavaDoc for more information on these classes.

### <a id="ref.table_reducer"> Table reducers </a>

`org.kiji.mapreduce.KijiTableReducer` is a specialization of a [`KijiReducer`]({{site.api_mr_1_0_0_rc62}}/KijiReducer.html) that writes cells
into an output Kiji table.
A table reduce must implement the logic to reduce the input values for an input key in
`reduce(InputKey key, Iterable<InputValue> values, KijiTableContext context)`,
using the table reducer `context` to write cells to the configured output table.

Below is an minimal example of a table reducer. This reducer is very similar to the
`FamilySizeReducer` above, but inherits from [`KijiTableReducer`]({{site.api_mr_1_0_0_rc62}}/KijiTableReducer.html), and is designed to output
to hfiles or directly into a Kiji table.

{% highlight java %}
/**
 * Example of a table reducer class that, for every zip code, calculates
 * the number of families per family size.
 *
 * For its input, this reducer expects the output from the FamilySizeGatherer
 * presented in the gatherer section of the user guide.
 * This gatherer emits a key-value pair for every household with:
 *   <li> the household zip code as a key;
 *   <li> the number of members in the household as a value.
 *
 * The output of this reducer is a table whose row keys are zip codes.
 * The reducer writes cells to a map-type family named 'sizes'.
 * Each cell is written to the column 'sizes:<family-size>' and contains
 * the number of families with the size encoded in the column qualifier.
 */
public class FamilySizeTableReducer
    extends KijiTableReducer<IntWritable, IntWritable> {

  /** {@inheritDoc} */
  @Override
  protected void reduce(
      IntWritable zipCode, Iterable<IntWritable> familySizes, KijiTableContext context)
      throws IOException {
    // Map: family size -> number of families with this size
    final Map<Integer, AtomicInteger> sizeMap = Maps.newHashMap();

    // Count the number of families with :
    for (IntWritable familySize : familySizes) {
      AtomicInteger count = sizeMap.get(familySize.get());
      if (count == null) {
        count = new AtomicInteger(0);
        sizeMap.put(familySize.get(), count);
      }

      // Increment the counter for this family size:
      count.incrementAndGet();
    }

    // Emit the generated family size map in the entity whose ID is zipCode:
    final EntityId eid = context.getEntityId(zipCode.toString());

    for (Map.Entry<Integer, AtomicInteger> entry : sizeMap.entrySet()) {
      final Integer familySize = entry.getKey();
      final int familyCount = entry.getValue().get();
      context.put(eid, "sizes", familySize.toString(), familyCount);
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This reducer may be chained to the FamilySizeGatherer described in the gatherer section of this user guide as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
kiji gather \
    --gatherer=my.application.package.FamilySizeGatherer \
    --reducer=my.application.package.FamilySizeTableReducer \
    --input="format=kiji table=kiji://.env/default/households_table_name" \
    --output="format=kiji table=kiji://.env/default/family_size_table_name nsplits=3"
{% endhighlight %}

This command line runs a gatherer chained with the table reducer presented above.
The output of the job is written to the live Kiji table specified with `kiji://.env/default/family_size_table_name`.
The number of gatherer tasks is currenlty set to be the number of regions in the input table.
The number of reducer tasks is controlled by the `nsplits` job output parameter, 3 in this example.
