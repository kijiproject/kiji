      configuration parameter. All instances on target cluster are visible.
      Manual refreshes can be triggered with a POST to the admin task
      /tasks/refresh_instances.

Version 1.1.0
  * REST-85. Add archetype for creating Kiji Rest plugins.
  * REST-63. KijiREST should have a mode to serve all Kiji instances in a cluster.
  * REST-84. kiji-rest script should allow specifying JVM arguments.
  * REST-76. KijiREST logging locations must be fully configurable
  * REST-79. Don't close the underlying Kiji instance.

Version 1.0.1
  * REST-50. Fix a performance issue that was causing massive slowdowns.

Version 1.0.0
  * REST-66. Incorporates native json formatted entity ids in POST.
      Cleans up row key specification language.
  * REST-64. Fix the exception handling to ensure that all exceptions
      are converted to JSON objects, stacktraces included and logged
      to the application log file on the server.
  * REST-48. Adds start_eid/end_eid and removes start_rk/end_rk.
  * REST-60. Removes the entityId endpoint of tables.
  * REST-50. Check that the table still exists before returning it in
      ManagedKijiClient.
  * REST-59. Ensure that if the writer_schema is JSON, that the server will
     accept the schema and parse it properly.

Version 0.6.0
  * REST-55. Remove an old servlet dependency. Also change the release artifact
     to not contain a single fat jar but house the runtime dependencies in the
     lib/ directory.
  * REST-54. Supports per-request freshening parameters.
  * REST-53. Remove the row endpoint. Can be accessed by /rows?eid=.
  * REST-32. Supports scanning with partially specified entity ids.
  * REST-49. Adds freshening/scoring parameter to KijiREST.

Version 0.5.0
  * REST-44. Remove the rowkey element from the output of the row.
  * REST-45. Output the writer schema_id on GET. Force the specification of the
      writer schema (either id or JSON) on POST to ensure that data specified can
      be written without throwing exceptions because of data being written
      according to the wrong writer schema.

Version 0.4.0
  * REST-40. Bugfix: Fix the issue where /instances/<instance> threw a
      500 error. This was due to an issue in converting Avro to JSON using

      specific record.
