                              Kiji Scoring Release Notes

Version 0.13.0
    * SCORE-168. All Public classes now have ApiAudience and ApiStability annotations to indicate
        to which users they are relevant and the contract around their API compatibility. Some
        erroneously extensible classes have been marked final (NewerThan, ScoreFunctionProducer,
        RunningLogarithmicBin, BatchScoreTool, FreshTool).
    * SCORE-166. Adds a JpmmlScoreFunction for scoring trained JPMML compliant models.

Version 0.11.0
    * SCORE-148. kiji batch-score is a new command line tool for running ScoreFunctions in batch.
    * SCORE-147. ScoreFunctionJobBuilder now supports running ScoreFunctions in batch without the
        need for a KijiProducer wrapper.

Version 0.10.0
    * SCORE-125. FreshRequestOptions now supports disabling individual columns to prevent them from
        being freshened by this corresponding request. To disable all columns, use the marked value
        DISABLE_ALL_COLUMNS found in FreshRequestOptions.
    * SCORE-139. KijiFreshnessPolicy now includes static constants named FRESH and STALE which can
        be returned from isFresh() to indicate that the data read was fresh or stale respectively.
    * SCORE-135. kiji-scoring-server has been removed from kiji-scoring to avoid a circular
        dependency. It now lives in its own project at github.com/kijiproject/kiji-scoring-server.

Version 0.9.0
    * SCORE-130. Adds a mutable, per thread kvstore to scoring server.

Version 0.8.0
    * SCORE-120. FreshKijiTableReader now supports providing an ExecutorService to use as the
        thread pool backing the reader. If unspecified, the reader will use the singleton service
        defined in FreshenerThreadPool.

Version 0.7.0
    * SCORE-128. InternalFreshKijiTableReader now uses a reader pool to read data to check for
        freshness and score in order to guarantee thread safety. The pool size defaults to the same
        as the FreshenerThreadPool size.
    * SCORE-118. InternalFreshKijiTableReader now includes DEBUG level log messages for important
        events. Enable these messages through your slf4j configuration.
    * SCORE-117. ScoreFunction.score() now returns a TimestampedValue which optionally specifies the
        timestamp at which the value should be written to Kiji.
    * SCORE-113. KijiScoring now includes a KijiProducer implementation called
        org.kiji.scoring.lib.produce.ScoreFunctionProducer which can run a ScoreFunction in batch.
        ScoreFunctions to be run in batch must meet certain requirements which are detailed in
        ScoreFunctionProducer's JavaDoc.
    * SCORE-112. FreshKijiTableReader.get(EntityId, KijiDataRequest, long) has been replaced by
        get(EntityId, KijiDataRequest, org.kiji.scoring.FreshKijiTableReader.FreshRequestOptions)
        which allows for the specification of an overriding timestamp and string-string parameters
        which will override parameters available to the KijiFreshnessPolicy and ScoreFunction for
        this request only.
    * SCORE-111. FreshKijiTableReaderBuilder has been moved into the FreshKijiTableReader interface
        and is now FreshKijiTableReader.Builder. All other FreshKijiTableReaderBuilder APIs remain
        the same.
    * SCORE-97. KijiScoring has undergone significant API changes. The KijiFreshnessPolicy SPI has
        been redesigned and KijiProducer has been replaced by a new SPI called ScoreFunction. These
        SPIs are designed specifically to support the use-case of real time scoring in a multi
        threaded environment. To support the new SPIs KijiFreshnessPolicyRecord has been replaced
        with KijiFreshenerRecord and KijiFreshnessManager has undergone a complete API revamp to
        support the new record type. FreshTool was also changed to reflect the new records and SPIs.
        FreshKijiTableBuiler has also seen several changes to support the new SPIs. Details of these
        new classes can be found in the JavaDoc for each.

Version 0.6.0
    * SCORE-40. FreshKijiTableReader now supports a `getStatistics()` method which returns
        statistics about Fresheners run by the reader. Statistics gathering and logging can be
        configured via `FreshKijiTableReaderBuilder.withStatisticsGathering()`.
    * SCORE-92. FreshTool now supports registering and retrieving the new optional record fields
        `parameters` and `reinitializeProducer`. e.g.
        kiji fresh \
          kiji://.env/default/table/family:qualifier \
          --do=register \
          --policy-class=my.Policy \
          --policy-state="" \
          --producer-class=my.Producer \
          --parameters={"key":"value"} \
          --reinitialize-producer=true
    * SCORE-83. InternalFreshKijiTableReader now respects KijiFreshnessPolicyRecord's `parameters`
        and `reinitializeProducer` fields. KijiFreshnessPolicy objects may access and override
        `parameters` via PolicyContext.getParameters() and setParameter(String, String). These will
        be written into the Configuration used by the KijiProducer and are available to the
        KijiProducer objects via KijiProducer.getConf(). `reinitializeProducer` will instruct the
        FreshKijiTableReader to intialize a new KijiProducer object for each request and configure
        the new producer to include values found in the possibly modified version of `parameters`
        returned from PolicyContext.getParameters(). A freshness policy may override the specified
        reinitialization behavior by calling PolicyContext.reinitializeProducer(boolean) during a
        call to KijiFreshnessPolicy.isFresh(KijiRowData, PolicyContext).
    * SCORE-85. KijiFreshnessPolicyRecord now support two optional fields, paramters which is a
        string-string mapping of configuration parameters which are made available to the policy
        via PolicyContext.getParameters() and the producer via KijiProducer.getConf(), and
        `reinitializeProducer` which is a boolean and instructs the FreshKijiTableReader to
        initialize a new KijiProducer on each request in order to pass in new configuration
        parameters safely.
    * SCORE-81. KijiFreshnessManager now support writing multiple records with a single call. No
        records will be written unless all records pass validation. Records to write together are
        accepted in the same form that they are returned by retrievePolicies(tableName) to support
        easy bulk modification of stored Freshener records.
        This patch also fixes an error in attachment validation which was permitting records to be
        attached to group type columns when another record was already attached.
    * SCORE-82. FreshKijiTableReader now supports rereadPolicies(List<KijiColumnName>) which causes
        the reader to reread policies from the metatable according to a new list of columns to
        freshen. The new list of columns to freshen permanently supercedes the previous list.
    * SCORE-75. InternalFreshKijiTableReader has been significantly refactored to improve
        maintainability. FreshKijiTableReader.rereadPolicies() no longer takes a boolean parameter
        to trigger preloading of KijiFreshnessPolicy and KijiProducer objects. Instead the reader
        proactively instantiates all policy and producer objects at construction and on calls to
        rereadPolicies. FreshKijiTableReader.preload(KijiDataRequest) has been removed as part of
        this change. Users with many attached freshness policies may now use
        FreshKijiTableReaderBuilder.withColumnsToFreshen(List<KijiColumnName>) to specify for which
        columns the constructed reader should run freshening. This list of columns will be used by
        calls to rereadPolicies() to determine which policies should be instantiated. This list of
        columns is immutable and only policies attached to columns in this list will ever be
        instantiated by this reader. Columns in this list may be fully qualified columns or
        families. Including a family in this list will include all policies attached to qualified
        columns within that family or the map family policy attached to the entire family.

Version 0.5.0
    * SCORE-78. Prepares KijiScoring for BentoBox. Many unnecessary dependencies have been
        removed. Missing newlines have been added in the FreshTool. README.md updated.
    * SCORE-77, SCORE-74. KijiScoring now properly releases all Kiji resources.
        FreshKijiTableReaders and KijiFreshnessManagers must be closed to release resources.
    * SCORE-76. FreshTool's --help option no longer requires a meaningless --do flag.

Version 0.4.0
  * SCORE-61. Resolve race conditions in InternalFreshKijiTableReader
  * SCORE-69. Local FreshKijiTableReader now creates only one table connection for all write
      operations.
  * SCORE-54. Writing using the ProducerContext in setup and cleanup will now produce an
      UnsupportedOperationException.  If you wish to write during these methods, use a
      KijiTableWriter instead.
  * SCORE-32. NewerThan now exposes a getter getNewerThanTimeInMillis() to retrieve the configured
      time before which data is considered stale.
  * SCORE-52. FreshTool now accepts File paths for policy state using the --policy-state-file flag.
  * SCORE-27. PolicyContext now supports a getStore(String) operation so that FreshnessPolicys can
      access KeyValue stores in calls to isFresh().

Version 0.3.0
  * SCORE-44. Producer output from freshened get() requests are now committed atomically based on
      the 'allow partial freshness' rule specified during table creation.  If partial freshness is
      allowed each producer will commit all of its writes atomically after produce() returns.  If
      partial freshness is not allowed, all writes will be cached until all producers associated
      with the same request have finished.  Partial freshness requires a separate table connection
      for each producer and does not guarantee that the output of one producer will not be used as
      input to another.  Given the high cost of table connections, partial freshening is not
      recommended and is disabled by default.

Version 0.2.0
  * SCORE-46. Freshness policies attached to qualified columns in map type families will now be
      triggered by requests to the entire map type family.
  * SCORE-49. Fixes ConcurrentModificationException in FreshKijiTableReader.rereadPolicies().
  * SCORE-48. Updates pom.xml versions to latest released versions of dependencies.
  * SCORE-47. KijiFreshnessManager and FreshTool now support post-attachment validation of
      freshness policies.
  * SCORE-45. FreshKijiTableReaderBuilder.get() is now FreshKijiTableReaderBuilder.create().
  * SCORE-34. FreshKijiTableReader.reloadPolicies has been renamed rereadPolicies to reflect the
      distinction from preload.
  * SCORE-22. KijiFreshnessManager store policy methods now include a variety of safety checks.
  * SCORE-41. FreshKijiTableReader now includes a preload method, which instantiates all objects
      necessary for freshening a given data request without side effects.
  * SCORE-39. FreshKijiTableReader now includes methods which override configured timeout durations.
  * SCORE-13. FreshKijiTableReaderFactory has been replaced with FreshKijiTableReaderBuilder.
  * SCORE-36. Makes the fresh CLI tool visible to the kiji tool launcher.
