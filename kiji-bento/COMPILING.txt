==  Welcome to the Kiji standalone repository ==

This repository assembles a standalone distribution of all Kiji components
and HBase-in-a-box.

This uses Maven's assembly:single operation in two phases (prepare-package
and package). The prepare-package operation unpacks all the dependency
tarballs into target/prereqs-dir. Then in package, it uses the release.xml
profile to copy fileSets into their final location in the true release
package.
